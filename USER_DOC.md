## Detailed instructions
Prerequesites: Docker, Make, VirtualBox and a Virtual Machine

- Change your VM's localhost IP to the domain name
    - Go to file /etc/hosts
    - Add following line : "127.0.0.1 login.42.fr"
    - Also change the IP adress in /etc/resolv.cnf file to 8.8.8.8
- Git clone the repository in your home folder
- Create 2 folders at `/home/your_login/data/` : `wordpress` and `mariadb` and, in the Makefile and the docker-compose.yaml file, change the paths from `/home/apeuget42/data/` to `/home/your_login/data/`
- cd inside the cloned repository
- Use `make start` to start Docker
- Use `make up` to build and launch the project, check every container properly started with `make check` (container should all show "up")
- Go to https://login.42.fr/ or to https://localhost:443/, if you get a 502 bad getway error, wait 5 seconds and refresh, wordpress might not have finished starting up
- For the administration panel, go to https://apeuget.42.fr/wp-admin/

- Use `make down` to stop containers and `make fclean` to delete everything, including volumes in the container and in the localhost (data folder)
- If you change anything to the files, use `make fclean` and `make re` to start clean and not reuse any cache from previous containers

## Locate and manage credentials
- For obvious security reasons, any credentials and environment variables are not provided in this repository
- At its root, create a folder named "secrets" and create one txt file for each username and each password, you should have only ONE information by txt file, for example db_root_password.txt contains "rootpassword1234" and db_user.txt contains "username42"
    - You need 7 of these files, the names should be:
        - db_user.txt
        - db_password.txt
        - db_root_password.txt
        - db_2nd_user.txt
        - db_2nd_user_password.txt
        - db_admin.txt
        - db_admin_password.txt
- In the srcs folder, create a file called .env and add this and replace the values with whatever you want:  
DB_NAME=adatabasename  
ADMIN_EMAIL=email@email.fr
DOMAIN_NAME=login.42.fr
